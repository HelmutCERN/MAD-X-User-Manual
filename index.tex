\section{MAD-X PLUGINS}

\madx provides a plug-in mechanism for functionality extensions. Plug-in
technique does not require linking at build time. The job is done at the
time plug-in is loaded by the dynamic linker.  In order to use any
plug-in, the plugin support must be compiled in \madx. At the top of
every \madx makefile there is variable PLUGIN\_SUPPORT that must be set
to "YES".  Then, the appropriate C interface is compiled in and \madx is
linked dynamically.   Plug-ins must be accessible to the dynamic linker.
The default location where plug-ins are searched is
\$HOME/.madx/plugins. Otherwise, the directory containing the library
must be either listed in   
\begin{enumerate}
   \item  the configuration file of the dynamic linker (on SLC3 it is
     /etc/ld.so.conf)  
   \item  \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} environment variable 
\end{enumerate}

Existing plug-ins  
\begin{enumerate}
   \item \texttt{RPLOT}
\end{enumerate}

The interface is not yet fully defined. The documentation apears at the moment it happens.
