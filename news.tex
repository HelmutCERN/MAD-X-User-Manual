\subsubsection{First MAD-X LHC commissioning version 3.04: 09.07.2007}
\begin{verbatim}

1) Allowing reading and writing of SDDS data sets for
communication with the LHC control system.
2) A large amount of medium size and smaller code changes
and bug fixes.
3) Full blown development for CLIC purposes.
4) New Jacobian matching method.
5) Non-linear and parametric matching.



All changes for each file:



=============================================================================

MAD-X proper
------------

C Files:
--------
- minor C inconsistencies and some clean-up
- Uninitiatized variables

aperture.c
- moved aperture code from madxn.c to new file aperture.c
- corrections:
- more apex in halo polygon
- corrected the construction of rectellipse in the general case
- secured potentially dangerous division by zero

c6t.c
- The brute force quick and dirty fix of frs has been reverted for a proper
fixing at the source of the problem, IE assigning different names for
different multipoles. It has been shown that SixTrack gives identical
results for the "brute force" and the "proper solution".
Courtesy Hans Grote (honorable ABP group member)
- Fixing the problem of using the same name for very different multipoles.
This is a quick fix and a more rigorous solution is needed.
- R(E)COLLIMATORs were treated as thick elements in the single element list
but later treated as thin elements leading to skrewed up linear optics
in SixTrack. They are kept as distinct elements and are not joined with
surrounding drifts.

gxx11c.c, gxx11psc.c
- Fix the month number in the ps files

madxc.c
- Added commands to allow reading of external orbit files
- Correct read_my_table for long data elements

madxe.c
- compiler warnings removed
- Changed default behaviour of ADD option

madxn.c, madxp.c, madxu.c
- moved aperture code from madxn.c to new file aperture.c
corrections:
- more apex in halo polygon
- corrected the construction of rectellipse in the general case
- secured potentially dangerous division by zero
- Avoid divisions by zero in the aperture module.
- minor C inconsistencies and some clean-up
- mad-X_3_66  bugs found by EK
- Array overflow reported from valgrind removed
- Special non-existing End marker has been dropped. courtesy HG
- mpar made compiling, three functions moved from matchc2.c to madxu.c
- current in table_list initialized to 0
- add warning when use_macro option is used with too many variables
- Introducing aptol_(1,2,3) "rtol", "xtol", "ytol" to be available in MAD-X
input and e.g. to be added to a TWISS table.      Courtesy H.G.
Now table2(x,y) or stable(a,b,c) or things like that will not be modified.
- First step for node layout tracking in ptc_trackline
- fix a bug when you use a macro which define another macro for matching
- madX-3_03_48: "Final" fix of the TILT saga! Tilt is calculated exclusively
in twiss.F following the strategy:
0) These changes concern quad, sext, oct, elec separator;
   but NOT dipole or multipole
1) TILT input is the external tilt (+k ==> +ks for tilt c)+1) the "+1" is essential
because the character string has a "\0" at the end.
2) In plot there is still the crash when reading the header - temporary
solution applied.
- Fix the headvalue routine which stumbled over a blank line. (courtesy HG)
- First step for node layout tracking in ptc_trackline
- Adding a C routine to read headers of TFS tables (courtesy  HG)
- Taking deltap from table header both for TWISS and ptc_twiss (but
  NOT in case of a SUMM table!) and place on the plot.
- Move the set_variable routine from madxn.c to madxu.c. Needed to compile
mpars.
- new setvar command; fixed readtable bug
- Removed redundant debug printout
- Exact name matching implemented, now passing name with :x
- VORNAME assigned, the same as name of node in MADX but with capital letters
- Updated match with knobs
- Constraints for ranges with match,use_macro; implemented
- Adding "e1", "e2", "h1", "h2", "hgap", "fint", "fintx" to the twiss table
- Removed charge setting to the my_ring layout to make ptc_twiss running, 
redundant printouts removed
- Moments calculation fully imlemented; map buffering in ptc_twiss
- Few bugs corrected (f.g. map initialized to nd2 instead of npara when 
initial twiss provided). Moments seem to work (to be tested yet)
- New ptc_twiss, so A_ is tracked. This makes possible tracking of moments 
(to be completed).
-Not enough memory for buffers ==> FODO: LINE=(36*(CELL)); failed when cell
was a line itself
- clean-up of gino
- Adding gino command following madx_ptc_script_module
- PTC knobs (pol_blocks) almost completely interfaced to MAD-X.
User sets a knob with ptc_knob command.
Twiss parameters and user specified (with ptc_select) map components are
buffered in memory after every element in form of taylor series.
 The problem with table (and tabstring) replacement was correctly
stated, only in this case did simple string replacement take place (bad
implememtation, my mistake). It has been corrected, the files concerned
are madxd.h, madxp.c, and madxu.h in ~hansg/public/tmp
Now table2(x,y) or stable(a,b,c) or things like that will not be modified.
- In new_command_parameter_list pointer array of parameters initized with NULLs
- Write only long in TFS tables
- "string function" tabstring count start at 1 courtesy Hans Grote
- Now alos ptc_normal accepted in matching with ptcknobs; bug corrections
- Implemented:
1. ptc_setfieldcomp that set any order field strengh
to requested value. It enables matching of higher order field components.
2. Special matching mode use_ptcknob. It implements kind of macro
that emplys parametric PTC calculations to perform matching in a faster manner.
For further details see the comments at the top of matchptcknobs.c file.
3. Minor corrections and protections against segmentation vilation.

Solution:courtesy Hans Grote
- PTC knobs (pol_blocks) almost completely interfaced to MAD-X.
User sets a knob with ptc_knob command.
Twiss parameters and user specified (with ptc_select) map components are
buffered in memory after every element in form of taylor series.
They can be dumped to text file in two formats with ptc_printparametric command.
They can be also visualized and further studied with rviewer from rplot plugin.
Further, user can set numeric values of knobs with ptc_setknobvalue what
updates all numeric values of the parameters in the tables.
This way knobs can be used in matching.
- New tracking feature by Andres Gomez Alonso:
Using flag "recloss" in the tracking command creates a table called
"trackloss", which keeps a record of lost particles. It can be saved
using the "write, table= trackloss" command.
- Changes for SDDS and online model
- knobs implemented with PTC with pol_blocks; command to dump parametric 
results to file or stdout; content of ptc_madx_tablepush.f90 moved to

- Typo corrected
- introduced correct treatment of magnet families
- Protection against deletion of NULL pointer added
- Parametric matching of initial conditions works now, final tests and debugging

C Header Files:
---------------

madx.h
- Add parameter (units) for orbit correction
- Added: Enumeration type for matching mode; protection against multiple 
inclusion.

madxl.h
- Definitions for tables used by Slice Tracking with PTC
- Momentum compaction "alfa" included into TWISS table for matching.
- Add "polarity" parameter to the twiss table
- Updated match with knobs
- Adding "e1", "e2", "h1", "h2", "hgap", "fint", "fintx" to the twiss table
- Suppressing "imax" in favor of "calib" - request by Thys Risselada
- Adding node value "kmax" (maximum K value) and "imax" (maximum Current value)
- New tracking feature by Andres Gomez Alonso:
Using flag "recloss" in the tracking command creates a table called
"trackloss", which keeps a record of lost particles. It can be saved
using the "write, table= trackloss" command.
- Added madX data types , mainly used in SDDS module
- New function "exist" courtesy Hans Grote
- Sodd table names usinf small letters only
- closing unit 34 to allow multiple SODD runs

Option for ptc_trackline added that switches on/off track parameters storage 
in memory for every slice
- Fix traditional matching of alfa
- First step for node layout tracking in ptc_trackline
- Added ptc names of twiss functions to constraint, hence one can set 
constraint in a range
- new setvar command; fixed readtable bug
- Add "polarity" parameter to the twiss table
- Clean-up
- wrap.f90
- Fixing the crash for sbend + exact + multipoles larger than 10. This set-up
requires to solve Maxwell's equation up to SECTOR_NMUL_MAX. The default is
set to 10 to avoid excessive computing time. This is now safeguarded in
madxp. To this end the parameters SECTOR_NMUL and SECTOR_NMUL_MAX are
transfered from "ptc_create_layout" to "ptc_create_universe" such that
these global parameters can be set early enough. Internally in PTC the
parameter "lda_used" is incremented where needed from 1500 to 3000 and set
back. Moreover Etienne has done the following modifications to make this
possible:
"The modification I made in the new PTC I sent you are as follows:
You first select SECTOR_NMUL and SECTOR_NMUL_MAX. For all
multipole  5 times smaller: 33% ==> 10%
2) Fortran90 Clean-up
- Changes needed to compile routine dlamc1 without optimization in extra file
matchlib2.F. Otherwise madx gets stuck in matching procedures. In all Linux
Makefiles matchlib2.F is compiled when using g77. For the Fortran90 compilers
lf95, g95, f95(NAG) and gfortran an optimized routine is used as provided by
Andy Vaught, the "g95" maintainer. For Windows the special compile flag:
-lfe "-D_G95" was needed (special undocumented Fujitsu compile flag of
the Lahey lf95) to compile this special Fortran90 version of dlamc1.
- Replacing the DLAMC1 by an improved Fortran90 one as proposed by
Andy Vaught
- remove Makefile_nag offending code
- New jacobian routine with svd. Option COND added for controlling the SVD. 
Increased number of constraints

matchlib2.F
- Needed to compile routine dlamc1 without optimization. Otherwise madx
gets stuck in matching procedures.

orbf.F

- Safeguard uncontrolled access to unsupported labels like Energy
- Fixing the plot crash: the header is not read if it does not exist
(courtesy HG).
-
1) Bad memory bug found by RdM. Piotr found using valgrind the solution:
in mymalloc("read_table", strlen(aux_buff->c)+1) the "+1" is essential
because the character string has a "\0" at the end.
2) In plot there is still the crash when reading the header - temporary
solution applied.
- Fix the headvalue routine which stumbled over a blank line. (courtesy HG)
- Preliminary fix of the crash when the aperture table is used
- Adding a C routine to read headers of TFS tables (courtesy  HG)
- Taking deltap from table header both for TWISS and ptc_twiss (but
  NOT in case of a SUMM table!) and place on the plot.
- Blanking out buffer if ptc_flag = true
- deltap plot entry taken from PTC plots

ptc_dummy.F
- First step for node layout tracking in ptc_trackline
- Missing dummy definitions added
- Moments calculation fully imlemented; map buffering in ptc_twiss
- New ptc_twiss, so A_ is tracked. This makes possible tracking of moments 
(to be completed).

1. ptc_setfieldcomp that set any order field strengh
to requested value. It enables matching of higher order field components.
2. Special matching mode use_ptcknob. It implements kind of macro
that emplys parametric PTC calculations to perform matching in a faster manner.

updates all numeric values of the parameters in the tables.
This way knobs can be used in matching.

- changing table entries to more logical names
- print   out clean up

trrun.F
- The argument "el" was removed from argument list of subroutine tmarb called
here (line 532 in trrun.F), because it did not coincide with the argument
list of the real subroutine tmarb in twiss.F.
- Bug found by Stefan Sorge in trrun/trinicmd: Variables 'bet0' and 'bet0i' were 
undefined, leading to erronous results. Corrected.
- Fixing: Unwanted changes commented.
- The aperture of the collimators was checked before undergoing the (possible) 
rotation at the entry of the element. Corrected now: If collimator has a roll 
angle ('tilt'), coordinates are transformed to the rotated local coordinate 
system and only after that apertures are checked.
- Add BV flag to the solenoids
- Some unnecessary changes taken out again by Andres Gomez Alonso.
- Inconsistent variable declarations of z0 encountered by Piotr when using
make -f Makefile_nag. Fixed.
- New tracking feature by Andres Gomez Alonso:
Using flag "recloss" in the tracking command creates a table called
"trackloss", which keeps a record of lost particles. It can be saved
using the "write, table= trackloss" command.
- safeguard faulty input
- change in beambeam command: usage of scattering beam
with different radial shapes is possible:
parameters:
bbshape: 1 (default) Gaussian, standard as before
         2 flattop (or trapezoidal)
         3 hollow-parabolic
width:   for bbshape=2: fractional width of edge region
         for bbshape=3: fractional width of the parabolic part
- Changing the conflicting "ksl" for the integrated solenoid strength to
"ksi".  This name is reserved for the vector of the integrated skew
multipoles "ksl={};". Thick solenoid can now have normal "knl" and skew

- Add "polarity" parameter to the twiss table
- madX-3_03_48: "Final" fix of the TILT saga! Tilt is calculated exclusively
in twiss.F following the strategy:
0) These changes concern quad, sext, oct, elec separator;
   but NOT dipole or multipole
1) TILT input is the external tilt (+k ==> +ks for tilt beta22,...)
- Bug corrected in the treatment of 4D and 5D cases; cosmetics;
- Universal taylor nullified at the initialization level
- Implemented:
1. ptc_setfieldcomp that set any order field strengh
to requested value. It enables matching of higher order field components.

Changes:
--------
- PTC May 2007
- VORNAME assigned, the same as name of node in MADX but with capital letters
- Fixing the crash for sbend + exact + multipoles larger than 10. This set-up
requires to solve Maxwell's equation up to SECTOR_NMUL_MAX. The default is
set to 10 to avoid excessive computing time. This is now safeguarded in
madxp. To this end the parameters SECTOR_NMUL and SECTOR_NMUL_MAX are
transfered from "ptc_create_layout" to "ptc_create_universe" such that
these global parameters can be set early enough. Internally in PTC the
parameter "lda_used" is incremented where needed from 1500 to 3000 and set
back. Moreover Etienne has done the following modifications to make this
possible:
"The modification I made in the new PTC I sent you are as follows:
You first select SECTOR_NMUL and SECTOR_NMUL_MAX. For all
multipole  4 and vice versa so NAG does not cry

Spc_pointers.f90, St_pointers.f90,

n_complex_polymorph.f90, o_tree_element.f90

Changes:
--------

- Throw out unused variables
- Fix single/double precision definition that crashed NAG f95
- logical=>logical(lp) needed for NAG f95
- Bug corrected - only first 10 elements of an array was zeroed instead of whole
- Check of initial conditions provided by the user on imput.
- pointers initialized to null in universal_taylor

e_define_newda.f90, f_newda.f90, g_newLielib.f90
- Experimental NEWDA no longer for this PTC version

=============================================================================

Makefiles
---------

Files:
------
Makefile, Makefile.bat, Makefile.prof, Makefile_develop, Makefile_g95,
Makefile_gdb, Makefile_gfortran, Makefile_nag, Makeonline

Changes:
--------
- moved aperture code from madxn.c to new file aperture.c
corrections:
- more apex in halo polygon
- corrected the construction of rectellipse in the general case
- secured potentially dangerous division by zero
- Cleaned code so NAG warnings are minimized now: mainly unused variables
- PTC May 2007
- "madx_ptc_normal_module"
- PTC version including spin
- Changes needed to compile routine dlamc1 without optimization in extra file
matchlib2.F. Otherwise madx gets stuck in matching procedures. In all Linux
Makefiles matchlib2.F is compiled when using g77. For the Fortran90 compilers
lf95, g95, f95(NAG) and gfortran an optimized routine is used as provided by
Andy Vaught, the "g95" maintainer. For Windows the special compile flag:
-lfe "-D_G95" was needed (special undocumented Fujitsu compile flag of
the Lahey lf95) to compile this special Fortran90 version of dlamc1.
- Adjustments to produce 32bit executables on AMD64 (not complete yet)
- New PTC 2007: mod to Makefile due to filename change
- plugin support off
- New ptc_twiss, so A_ is tracked. This makes possible tracking of moments 
(to be completed).
- New gino PTC version
- Take out "-fno-second-underscore" from the gcc flags. Add "LIBX" for FC5
as a comment.
- change in the print out of match summary when USE_MACRO
- Implemented:
1. ptc_setfieldcomp that set any order field strengh
to requested value. It enables matching of higher order field components.
2. Special matching mode use_ptcknob. It implements kind of macro
that emplys parametric PTC calculations to perform matching in a faster manner.
For further details see the comments at the top of matchptcknobs.c file.
3. Minor corrections and protections against segmentation vilation.
- linker option added to export main program symbols so the function can be 
used from plugins
- plugin support switched off by default
- Optional plugin support added, that requires dynamic linking. Switched-Off 
by default.
- corrected error
- knobs implemented with PTC with pol_blocks; command to dump parametric 
results to file or stdout; content of ptc_madx_tablepush.f90 moved to 
ptc_madx_knobs.f90, the former one removed
- Sceleton for knobs and arbitrary element placement implemented. Lattice 
visualization via ROOT macro. Printing detailed lattice geometry in PTC. 
Several small bug corrections and some code cosmetics.
- Missing dependencies added
- PTC with crash security!
First BB

Makefile.bat
- JMJ: Added line to compile fatchlib2.f and modified lines to link it into 
madx.exe and madxp.exe.

Makefile_gfortran
- Makefile using gfortran - not working yet for PTC

Makeonline
New files for MAD-X On-Line Modeling Version

-PTC Upgrade:
1) Improved Knobs
2) Acceleration
3) Add rectellipse aperture
4) Kill memory leaks

-More on PTC Upgrade:

In Etienne's words:

The type pancake will be made of equidistant slices in cylindrical
coordinates amenable to rk2 or rk4 integration (nonsymplectic).
I will tentatively represent bx,by,bz by a polynomial in x-y. This
polynomial will be extracted using Berz's wavelets.... This is my plan.

I will most likely destroy fitted magnets and this experimental multip.
Both will be taken over by pancake....

\subsubsection{MAD-X version 2.12:  FS 29.09.2004}
\begin{verbatim}


Summary:
Main new addition is the SODD module added courtesy Eric
d'Amico. Split madxn.c madxu.c into the parser part madxp.c and the
rest back to madxn.c madxu.c (courtesy HG). The parser consists only
of these three routines and the MAD-X header files. This allows to
attach other applications to the MAD-X parser as requested by SLAC and
Cornell. It can read and save (MAD8 format as well!) beams,variables,
elements and sequences. In the routine "control" one can add hooks
for any additional command as required by the parser users. The parser
is provided as an extra program in the binary directory for Linux,
Windows and MAC OS-X.

Changes in version mad-X 1.12:
=============================

++++++++
Changes:
++++++++

1) Safeguard free to avoid "segmentation faults" using "myfree"
2) orbf.F: Changes to allow correction to target orbit.
Remove unused and uninitialized variable lgfile.
3) Fixing position matching
4) SXF mods to protect against loose user input:
-when the position is missing, it is inserted directly behind the preceding
element, like for a LINE.
-If a bend does have "arc" undefined it uses "l" as length.
Courtesy of Hans Grote.
5) Clean-up and Windows Version Compatibility
6) Remove command EFIELD from dictionary madxdict.h
7) We had an old value of the "Unified Atomic Mass Unit", spotted by J. Jowett.
8) Element lengths had to be defined before the definition of the element,
i.e. concerning length the ":=" operator did not function properly.
Detected by AV solved by HG
9) If a one or both plains are unstable you now get the
"cosmux,cosmuy" for evaluation and a warning instead of a program
exit.
10) orbf.F: Changes to allow correction to target orbit.
Remove unused and uninitialized variable lgfile.
11) New set command
  a) variable format of printout
  b) select current sequence 
12) Change beam command on request:
for ion only:
  a) give total energy
  b) use mass & charge
  c) attribute nucleon suppressed 
13) Adding arbitrary matrix element twiss, thintrack & makethin 
14) Fix plot problem of variables starting with 'r' which had been
stripped.
15) Slicing of solenoid
16) New free in the orbit part plus minor clean-up.
17) When "Cycle"ing the machine internally a marker was created with a 
separate name. However, when using "save" afterwards 2 identical
markers were defined causing a crash.
18) Obsolete options removed for TRACK and DYNAP / AV
19) A faulty "free" caused the "remove of ranges" to fail.

Changes with respect to the previous version:

Changes in version mad-X 1.11:
=============================

+++++++++++++
Main Changes:
+++++++++++++

1) Introduce missing stability check in the vertical plane (AV&FS).
2) Introduce missing aperture attributes when saving to a file (HB).
3) Problem solved with the plot module, i.e. due the change from
"k0/k0s" to "angle/tilt" the info about bends was missing such that 
the figures of the dispersion displayed nasty and unphysical kinks (Td'A&FS).
4) PC version it became necessary to drop trailing blanks and special
characters from all files. All ".f" had to renamed ".F" to allow precompiling
with compiler directives (JJ&FS).
5) A very first and still buggy PC version is available (JJ). However, checks
have been done to verify that LINUX version still works fine (WH&FS).

\subsubsection{MAD-X version 1.10:  HG & FS 20.01.2003}
\begin{verbatim}

Changes with respect to the previous version:

Changes in version mad-X 1.10:
=============================

New commands:

coguess,x=..,px=..,y=..,py=..,t=..,pt=..,tolerance=..;

introduces the user's guess of the closed orbit start; it will be
used for all subsequent TWISS executions.
tolerance is the maximum error (in any component) for the closed
orbit convergence test (default = 1.e-6).

threader,vector={xmax,ymax,att}; defaults: {5.e-3,5.e-3,1.}

sets the parameters for the threader (see below).
xmax, ymax: orbit excursion (at a monitor) at which threader acts;
att       : attenuation factor for the kicks applied by the threader.

New command parameters:

twiss,keeporbit,useorbit;
match,useorbit;

The keeporbit (with an optional name, keeporbit=name) stores the orbit
under this name at the start, and at all monitors.

useorbit (with an optional name, useorbit=name) uses the start value
provided for the closed orbit search; the values at the monitors are
used by the threader (see below).

match,useorbit;

transfers the useorbit request to the Twiss module.

option,threader;

When set, the threader checks at all monitors the difference with
respect to the stored orbit there (from keeporbit) if useorbit is
present. The threader then provides kicks (if possible) to reduce
the orbit difference below the maxima specified on the threader
command. This procedure allows to thread with orbit bumps present.

save,class=..,pattern="..";

The save command without sequence specification saves all sequences
present, their elements, and their variables (this is not new).
When a class is specified in addition, all saved elements must belong
to that class; when a pattern is specified, the names of all
sequences, elements, and variables saved must match the regular
expression provided. Example: the user want to save all variables
containing the string"mb", and only those, i.e. no elements:

save,class=nonesuch,pattern="mb.*";

beam,particle=ion,nucleon=..;

The ion has the following effect:
the total mass is set to nucleon (a real number) * nmass (an average
nucleon mass); the total energy is set to charge * beam_energy.
See as well the IBS module documentation.





\subsubsection{MAD-X version 1.09:  FS 09.12.2002}
\begin{verbatim}

Changes with respect to the previous version:


New Developments and Important Fixes:
*************************************

A) New SXF Module:
------------------

Introduction of the SXF module - reading and writing SXF files  - HG 4.12.02

B) Tilt restored:
-----------------

Tilt restored, global tilt introduced in Twiss and Survey Module

C) MadX SixTrack Convertor:
---------------------------

a) Fixed bug allowing evaluation of expressions for aperture parameter.

b) A vertical field error is no longer treated as a vertical kicker. The same
cure is used as for the horizontal case.

c) fixed two problems:
1. missing last component of a (skew) multipole.
2. multipoles with dipole component are now correctly split with the b1 
component listed in the fc.2 file. (altered subroutine pre_multipole)

d) Kickers are now converted properly MH & FS

e) Addition of tilt to sixtrack input. (MH+FRS)

f) Minor formatting changes to remove superfluous comments.

g) Addition of tilt_err flag (MH+FRS).

D) Important Add-Ons:
---------------------

1. Access to multipole components from the command line:  
   name->k0l, name->k0sl etc.

2. Addition of variables to (any internal) table:
   select,flag=table,column=name,s,betx,...,var1,var2,...; ot
   select,flag=table,full,column=var1,var2,...; ! default col.s + new
   will write the current value of var1 etc. into the table each trime
   a new line is added; values from the same (current) line can be
   accessed by these variables, e.g.
   var1:= sqrt(beam->ex*table(twiss,betx));
   in the case of table above being "twiss". The plot command accepts
   the new variables.
   Remark: this replaces the "string" variables of MAD-8

3. User-defined tables:
   create,table=name,column=var1,var2,...;
   creates a table with the columns specified.
   fill,table=name;
   adds one line to the table with the current values of var1 etc.
   write,table=name{,file=filename};  ! {} means "optional"
   will write the table in TFS format onto the file or, if missing,
   onto standard output.
   Remark: this replaces the "push" etc. commands of MAD-8

   HG 9.12.2002


Fixes and Minor Improvements:
*****************************

a) Fixing bug in match range - HG 22.11.2002

b) Added a working array in the 'mtmigr' function definition.

c) Introduced advertised defaults for  and  for plot module

d) Tolerance changed into maxaper for tracking and dynap AV+FS

e) Bug fix in tracking: deltap on TRACK command now transmitted
INFO from TWISS suppressed if called from matching  -  HG 20.11.02

f) modified slicer to copy tilt parameter across again.

g) Slicer: Fixed LRAD bug. Because of default l=0 the lrad was always 
being overwritten by the length when sliced (it assumed the user had asked 
for a length=0 element). NEW DEFAULT: any object with length=0 is just 
copied to the thin sequence and not "sliced". i.e. magnetic elements are 
only converted to thin_mutipoles if they have a length. If they have no 
length they retain their original type. (i.e. l=0 sextupoles remain 
sextupoles).

h) Introduction of character string length of names for all Fortran modules. 
(AV&FS)

i) Modified the working array numbers for 'symeig' subroutine.

j) Added a working array for the MIGRAT routine.

k) SUELEM, SUMTRX AND SUTRAN moved to util.f (used also in twiss). AV+FS

l) Misalignment of apertures introduced. AV

m) Dimension of al_errors changes to 14. It compiles. No other test. AV

n) Tolerance changed into maxaper AV+FS

o) Accidental FORTRAN90 feature found in FORTRAN77 subroutine charconv: "

-Added range to TWISS and MATCH

-Added SIGT to twiss file header                  -  HG 14.11.02

-Windows Version in progress:
#ifndef exclusion of body of exec-plot is a temporary fix so that
the WIN32 version does not try to do X11 graphics.
However this has the consequence that the program will not
make Postscript files either.  HG will make a clean separation of
these  graphics functions later. (JMJ).  With this change the WIN32
version now compiles but does not yet link.

-Introducing _WIN32 flag  - HG 6.11.02

-add current_eopt command to allow the show command to show the updated eoption(s)

-Error module:
Changes to allow assignment of relative errors to multipoles with
only skew components, this requires a NEGATIVE radius

Bugs Fixes and minor Changes:
----------------------------- 

-Communicates maxmul parameter between twiss and trrun.

-In the call suelem the 4th passed variable was missing.

-Fixed bug in trrun (buffer with max. number of particles)  HG 22.10.02

-Changed template for trrun AV & FS

-Fixed bug in trrun (buffer with max. number of particles)  HG 22.10.02

-Restoring the definition of el in ttrf AV & FS

-Fixed minor typo in track_run and track_dynap. Print message when exiting the
track module. This helps to avoid confusion since before after a missing start
command nothing was written at all.

-Marguerite introduced and tested on single element.

-Correction of Phi and Psi. Yet to be tested on transfer lines. AV

-atan2 removed from survey FS & AV

-changed thin creation to allow inheritance of the aperture parameter correctly.

-Fixing missing k0 in SAVE

-Replacing min and max by mymin and mymax

-Introducing _WIN32 flag  - HG 6.11.02

-Fixed buf_dxt, buf_dyt for both track_dynap and track_run which call trrun AV & FS

-Increased number of dp numbers to 100000000

-Introduced _WINDOWS_ compile flag - HG 29.10.02

-Fixed bug in table value evaluation - HG 21.10.02

-Fixed bug in write_nice (SAVE output) - HG 17.10.02

-Fixed bug in seqedit INSTALL (simultaneous element definition)

-Fixed trivial bug in expression list copy routine -

-Removing second level of includes in c6t.c,

-moved include of c6t.h to madxn.c (JMJ).

-Fixed trivial bug in expression list copy routine -

-Clean-up of emit.f and madxdict.h                 -  HG 28.10.02

-Fixing output format of SAVE statement

-Fixing missing k0 in SAVE

-Replacing min and max by mymin and mymax

-Fixed bug in sectormap file creation - HG 3.11.02

-Fixed trivial bug in expression list copy routine -

-Fixed bug in special command check - HG 8.11.02

-Removing second level of includes in c6t.c,

-moved include of c6t.h to madxn.c (JMJ).

-Fixing output format of SAVE statement





\subsubsection{MAD-X version 1.06:  FS 16.10.2002}
\begin{verbatim}

Changes with respect to the previous version:

New command MONCUT in correction module
Addition of EMIT module - HG 15.10.02
Correction of RF cavity map
Correction in drift slicing
Additions to track tables
Estetics in slicer MH





\subsubsection{MAD-X version 1.05:  HG 25.9.2002}
\begin{verbatim}

Changes with respect to the previous version:

SURVEY:
correction of multipole treatment, various small mods.

ORBIT CORRECTION:
Orbit correction module changed to make 3 algorithms
available: MICADO, LSQ (Least Squares correction) and
SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). Selected with MODE
option in the CORRECT command.
The latter technique can optionally be used to configure
the response matrix for MICADO or LSQ to avoid bumps
and unphysical corrector strengths. Selected with
COND=1 option in the CORRECT command.
Highly recommended: read the forthcoming report before
use.
\end{verbatim}



\subsubsection{New sample job to create footprints for LHC:  HG 18.9.2002}
\begin{verbatim}

/afs/cern.ch/group/si/slap/share/mad-X/test_suite/foot/V1.04/footprint.mad

Creates a footprint for head-on + parasitic collisions at IP1+5 
of lhc.6.4; both lhcb1 (for tracking) and lhcb2 (to define the
beam-beam elements, i.e. weak-strong) are used; there are flags to
select head-on, left, and right parasitic separately at all IPs.
The bunch spacing can be given in nanosec and automatically creates
the beam-beam interaction points at the correct positions.
It is important to set the correct BEAM parameters, i.e. number
of particles, emittances, bunch length, energy.

The output file "footprint" can be viewed with gnuplot:

gnuplot
plot "footprint" w l
